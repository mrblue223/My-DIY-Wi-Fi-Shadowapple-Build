# My-DIY-Wi-Fi-Shadowapple-Build
This project documents a hardware build of a DIY Wi-Fi Pineapple using the GL.iNet AR300M16-Ext (Shadow) travel router. By leveraging the router's Atheros chipset and dual high-gain external antennas, this build replicates the functionality of professional pentesting hardware for a fraction of the cost.
