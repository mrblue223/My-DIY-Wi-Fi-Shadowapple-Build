This repository documents my personal build of the **Wi-Fi Shadowapple**, a budget-friendly wireless auditing tool inspired by the "Shadowapple" series by [Shuriken Hacks](https://www.youtube.com/@ShurikenHacks).

## 🏗️ Hardware Profile
For this build, I utilized a dedicated travel router for superior stability and portability compared to standard SBC builds.

| Component | Part Selection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Device** | **GL.iNet GL-AR300M16-Ext (Shadow)** |
| **External Radio** | High-Gain 5dBi - 8dBi SMA Antennas |
| **Antenna Type** | Detachable RP-SMA (External) |
| **Power** | 5V/2A Micro-USB |

### Why the AR300M16-Ext?
The **Shadow** (AR300M) is ideal for this build because of its Atheros chipset compatibility with advanced wireless auditing tools and its external antenna ports, which allow for significantly increased range.
