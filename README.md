## 🏗️ Hardware Profile
For this build, I moved away from the SBC-only approach and utilized a dedicated travel router for better stability and portability.

| Component | Part Selection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Device** | **GL.iNet GL-AR300M16-Ext (Shadow)** |
| **External Radio** | High-Gain 5dBi - 8dBi SMA Antennas |
| **Antenna Type** | Detachable RP-SMA (External) |
| **Power** | 5V/2A Micro-USB |

### Why the AR300M16-Ext?
The **Shadow** (AR300M) is ideal for this build because of its Atheros chipset compatibility with advanced wireless auditing tools and its external antenna ports, which allow for significantly increased range compared to the standard model.
